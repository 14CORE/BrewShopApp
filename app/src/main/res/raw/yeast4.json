This yeast strain produces a beautiful and delicate balance of banana esters and clove phenolics similar to the popular Wyeast 3068. However, this strain will sediment rapidly, resulting in bright beer without filtration. The balance can be manipulated towards ester production through increasing fermentation temperature, increasing the wort density, and decreasing the pitch rate. Over pitching can result in a near complete loss of banana character. Sulfur is commonly produced, but will dissipate with conditioning.","yeastType":"wheat","attenuationMin":70,"attenuationMax":76,"fermentTempMin":63,"fermentTempMax":75,"alcoholToleranceMin":10,"alcoholToleranceMax":10,"productId":"3333","supplier":"Wyeast","yeastFormat":"liquid","category":"yeast","categoryDisplay":"Yeast","createDate":"2013-06-24 16:09:27","updateDate":"2013-06-24 16:10:53"},{"id":1648,"name":"Gervin English Ale Yeast","category":"yeast","categoryDisplay":"Yeast","createDate":"2013-06-24 16:09:07"},{"id":1801,"name":"Hefeweizen Ale","description":"This famous German yeast is a strain used in the production of traditional, authentic wheat beers.
