Sister hops from the same program include Liberty, Crystal, and Mount Hood. Unlike its half-sisters, which tend to resemble Hallertauer and other German hops, Ultra retains a Saaz-like character and is recommended as a domestic substitute for Saaz in Bohemian pilsener and other lagers where Saaz is characteristic.","countryOfOrigin":"US","alphaAcidMin":4.5,"betaAcidMin":3.6,"betaAcidMax":4.7,"humuleneMin":30,"humuleneMax":40,"caryophylleneMin":10,"caryophylleneMax":15,"cohumuloneMin":25,"cohumuloneMax":30,"myrceneMin":25,"myrceneMax":35,"farneseneMax":1,"category":"hop","categoryDisplay":"Hops","createDate":"2013-06-24 16:07:39","updateDate":"2013-06-24 16:10:38","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":154,"name":"Vanguard","description":"Vanguard is a low-cohumulone diploid American aroma hop derived from a Hallertauer Mittelfruh descendant.
