This yeast strain produces a beautiful and delicate balance of banana esters and clove phenolics. The balance can be manipulated towards ester production through increasing the fermentation temperature, increasing the wort density, and decreasing the pitch rate. Over pitching can result in a near complete loss of banana character. Decreasing the ester level will allow a higher clove character to be perceived. Sulfur is commonly produced, but will dissipate with conditioning. This strain is very powdery and will remain in suspension for an extended amount of time following attenuation. This is true top cropping yeast and requires fermenter headspace of 33%.","yeastType":"wheat","attenuationMin":73,"attenuationMax":77,"fermentTempMin":64,"fermentTempMax":75,"alcoholToleranceMin":10,"alcoholToleranceMax":10,"productId":"3068","supplier":"Wyeast","yeastFormat":"liquid","category":"yeast","categoryDisplay":"Yeast","createDate":"2013-06-24 16:09:30","updateDate":"2013-06-24 16:10:53"},{"id":1753,"name":"West Yorkshire Ale","category":"yeast","categoryDisplay":"Yeast","createDate":"2013-06-24 16:09:15"},{"id":1860,"name":"Whitbread Ale","description":"A mildly malty and slightly fruity fermentation profile.
