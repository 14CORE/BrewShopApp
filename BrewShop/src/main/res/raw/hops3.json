Only Tettnanger hops grown in the Tettnang should be referred to as Tettnang Tettnanger. It is prized for its spicy, floral noble character, and is genetically very similar, if not identical, to the Saaz cultivar grown in the Czech Republic. Hops described as \"Tettnanger\" are also grown in the United States, Switzerland, and Australia, but these American Tettnanger, Swiss Tettnanger, and Australian Tettnanger hops are generally not be the true Tettnanger cultivar, but are thought to be Fuggle or a descendant of Fuggle. Since \"Tettnanger\" cultivation is traditional in Switzerland, it is most likely that these Swiss \"Tettnanger\" were never Tettnanger hops to begin with, but that rhizomes were exported under that name. In recent years, a few growers have tried growing true Tettnanger hops in the United States, but because of the confusion of names, these are almost impossible to find or identify.","countryOfOrigin":"DE","alphaAcidMin":3.5,"alphaAcidMax":3.5,"betaAcidMin":3.5,"betaAcidMax":5,"humuleneMin":20,"humuleneMax":25,"caryophylleneMin":6,"caryophylleneMax":10,"cohumuloneMin":23,"cohumuloneMax":29,"myrceneMin":20,"myrceneMax":25,"farneseneMin":12,"farneseneMax":16,"category":"hop","categoryDisplay":"Hops","createDate":"2013-06-24 16:10:37","country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":143,"name":"Tettnanger (American)","description":"American hops sold as Tettnanger hops often claim to be the same cultivar as the famous German aroma hop Tettnang Tettnanger.

The most likely explanation is that American hop growers imported the so-called Swiss Tettnanger hops, which may also have been Fuggle hops misrepresented as Tettnanger for marketing purposes.
